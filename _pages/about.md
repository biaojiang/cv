I’m now a Data Scientist & researcher in [Sandvik Coromant](https://www.sandvik.coromant.com/en-gb/pages/default.aspx), Sweden. The main work was envisaged to promote the implementations of IoT and Industry 4.0 in digital machining.

From Dec 2016 to Dec 2018, I was a Postdoc and principal research engineer in Umeå University for medical ultrasound research, of which the objective was to provide new risk-markers for arterial plaque vulnerability. 

From Aug 2014, I was a researcher in [Luleå University of Technology](https://ltu.se) (LTU) for an EU project - BondTest, for which several advanced ultrasonic non-destructive testing (NDT) methods and software were developed and evaluated by different diffusion-bonded metallic materials. 

My main interests are acoustics and array signal processing, and I received my Ph.D in underwater acoustics and signal processing from [Institute of Acoustics](https://english.ioa.cas.cn), Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2005. Since then, I have been performing on ocean acoustics research for quite a few years. In 2013, I started a PostDoc research in [SiPLAB](https://siplab.fct.ualg.pt), University of Algarve, Portugal, where a new vector sensor array-based ocean exploration research was conducted.
